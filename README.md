# RESEARCH QUESTION
The research question is the what kind of the factors will impact the success rate of the skill immigration rate. 
The reason I want this question to be my research question is because as an international student, when we apply for the job, the application form will always ask do you need sponsorship in the future. Therefore, I feel interested people which what kind of background will gain more opportunity to be successful in the skill immigration.
According to do the research, I find the dataset from the following aspect:
•	The industry growth trend
•	Skills needed by each industry
•	Skills peneration of each industry
•	Major to match the skills
•	The university’s ranking with the above major
•	People who are successful immigrate are from which country
•	The income level classification of the country they come from 
The reason I use this kind of the dataset is because I want to focus on the skill immigration. Therefore, the first I could think is what kind of the industry growth better so that they will hire more employee and the hot industry needs what kind of skills so that people who are with that kind of skills could have more chance to be successful. 

However, according to some research paper, we could know that more and more industry needs multi-skill people, therefore, we need to know the skill penetration of each industry to find these kind of multi-development/multi-skill talents. When we mentioned to the skills, we must consider the major they are in since people with different major will emphasis on the various skills. 

The reason why I need the university ranking is due to the education background. In the university, they will have some strengthen subject. Therefore, as the skill immigration, the education background will be the one of the significant parts. After all, most of famous company has its own target school. Therefore, the university ranking is considered as an impacted factor by me. 

Original country is also one of my considerations is because as an international student, we will be asked that whether you are from Singapore, Australia. According to my research, I know that people from these kind countries will have a different kind of working visa compared to the other countries. Therefore, country should also be considered. 

Finally, I know that it will be a little abnormal to associate with the income level of the original country as an impacted factor. In my mind, if you from the low-income country, it may not be easy to be accepted by the high-income country. This is just my thought; it still needs to be analyzed. But I will find it in my final dataset which will be useful for the future research. 

# DATASET

1.	Public Use - Talent Migration

https://development-data-hub-s3-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ddhfiles/144635/public_use-talent-migration.xlsx
this is the overall dataset to contain the country migration, skill migration and industry migration. The weakness is a Moderate dataset with structured format, but it will need some transformation for combination. 
The processing for this dataset is it has 3 sheets in one dataset, I need to pick up each of them to do the data cleaning and integrate with other data set. I know how to pick up it. But I am still having trouble to understand the meaning of each column to find the common area to integrate. I still need to find some resource. The dataset 1-4 is from the same data resource website. Therefore, dataset 1-4 has the same question in current process.
2.	Public Use - Skill Penetration By Industry Global

This dataset is useful since it gives the skills needed by each industry and what is the most updated skills needed by the industry. The weakness is a Moderate dataset with structured format, but it will need some transformation for combination.

This data is useful for me to know the ranking of the university which is related to my dataset topic. The weakness is a hard dataset I still need to write code to get the data from the website and combine the data in the good structure. 
Since this dataset still needs to web scraping. I am not familiar with it now. Therefore, I am not knowing what kind of the format of dataset will I get finally. I am worried about whether it will have a huge trouble to do the data cleaning. The meaning of the column is not that hard to understand like dataset 1-4.

# Technologies and skills
Python is the main language ( Jupyter notebooks, pandas, NumPy)
Data cleaning for all datasets (null)
Data integration for all datasets (common area)
Web scraping for the ranking information

# What do you like about this project?
This topic is good for me to find the job and tell me what kind of skill I still need to learn for applying a job as an international student.
